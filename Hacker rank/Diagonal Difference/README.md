## Question
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix `arr` is shown below:
> 
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  

The left-to-right diagonal = 15. The right to left diagonal = 17. Their absolute difference is 2.


#### Function description

Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

- int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

#### Return

- int: the absolute diagonal difference
#### Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, `n` , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix `arr`.
Each of the next  lines describes a row, , and consists of  space-separated integers .

#### Constraints

- -100 <= arr[i][j] <= 100

#### Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.
